                <h2>Jack Rothacker</h2>
                <p>My name is Jack Rothacker, and I am in my third year at North Carolina State University, studying Spanish & Entrepreneurship. I grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, where I had the privilege of attending a magnet school named Collinswood Language Academy. This is where I developed my passion for learning about new cultures, the Spanish language, and travel. I founded this nonprofit with the goal of changing the world. While this mission is broad, I still specify in local communities where relationships have been built and trust has been established.</p>
