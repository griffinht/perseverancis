            <div class="story-content">
                <p>Perseverancia has its origin from a 7-day visit to El Salvador in 2023, where I had the first-hand opportunity to know the needs and realities of the infrastructure of the classrooms, field, pedagogical resources, and lack of materials in the classroom. The focus was learning about the functioning of the educational institution Liceo Juan Calvino that is established in a very impoverished area of the District of Soyapango.</p>
                
                <p>After the trip, the only thing going through my mind was to find a way to help. The decision arose from three values: Support and help an amazing community, create advocacy about the educational system of El Salvador and positively change a student's life through an educational opportunity. In an arts entrepreneurship class, a teacher started the class by saying "Take risks", "This is the time to take the leap" and "The time to start is now". After realizing that GoFundMe (the initial idea for fundraising) did not work with Central American banks, there was no other option than to start a nonprofit and go after the goal of building a third cycle for Juan Calvino. Perseverancia was founded on September 22, when Rothacker was a 20-year-old junior at NC State University. It was approved by the IRS on October 10. Since then, it has been nothing less than a hard working journey.</p>
                
                <p>The decision to make a two-month second visit in 2024, was behind a dedicated plan to be immersed in the social, educational reality of Juan Calvino and other communities that have been helped by the organization. This visit was crucial for the planning of the accomplishment of the third cycle.</p>
                
                <p>Perseverancia is an established 501(c)(3) to conduct the following administrative, partner, management and strategic plan to create impact along all of El Salvador.</p>
