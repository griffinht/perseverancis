                <p>The Juan Calvino School (Liceo Juan Calvino) is a small private school located in Soyapango, El Salvador. They only have classrooms for students from kindergarten through 6th grade. They are looking to expand their facilities to fit at least one more classroom and fill it with students ready to learn. This school is affiliated with the IRCES church also located in the small community. Their end goal is to fundraise $21,000 ($16,000 for the classroom and $5,000 for the school materials).</p>
